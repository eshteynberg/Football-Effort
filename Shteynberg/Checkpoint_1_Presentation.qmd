## Background and Motivation

* Not all rushing yards are equal 

* Traditional stats miss the "how" behind yards gained

* Can we "measure" effort using tracking data?

* No universal way to evaluate effort 

  - Intangible and subjective
  - Depends on player position, defense faced, game context, snap count/play volume, play call/assignment



## Our Data: 2022 NFL Season 

* Game, play, player, tracking data from Weeks 1-9 [^1]

* Running plays where a running back (RB) is the ball carrier

* Trimmed each play to frames between handoff and end of play

* Backed out key features:

  - Kinetic energy (KE)= 1/2 mv^2^
  - Positive work = max {Î”KE, 0}
  - Horizontal displacement of RB
  - Aggregated per-play and per-player metrics
