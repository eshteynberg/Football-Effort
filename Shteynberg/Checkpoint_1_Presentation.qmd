## Background and Motivation

* Not all rushing yards are equal 

* Traditional stats miss the "how" behind yards gained

* Can we "measure" effort using tracking data?

* No universal way to evaluate effort 

  - Intangible and subjective
  - Depends on player position, defense faced, game context, snap count/play volume, play call/assignment



## Our Data: 2022 NFL Season 

* Game, play, player, tracking data from Weeks 1-9 [^1]

* Running plays where a running back (RB) is the ball carrier

* Trimmed each play to frames between handoff and end of play

* Backed out key features, aggregated per-play and per-player:

  - Kinetic energy (KE) = 1/2 mv^2^
  - KE consistency = mean(KE) / sd(KE)
  - Positive work = max {ΔKE, 0}
  - Horizontal displacement of RB in yards

## Increasing KE and sustained positive work can lead to high yardage plays

## Among our effort metrics, Avg KE best predicts Avg EPA

## Early thoughts on methods

* Regression and correlation to determine which effort metric(s) align best with high impact plays

* Residual effort estimation: predict minimum effort needed to avoid a tackle and compare to actual effort to measure excess ("residual") effort

* Logistic regression, random forest, etc to predict likelihood of tackle broken or play success from effort and related metrics

* Clustering to classify RBs by effort-reward profile and identify archetypes of RB behavior

## Plan of action

* Define research question and scope ✅

* Data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA ✅

* Select effort metric(s)

* Use chosen metric(s) to answer questions related to effort (residual effort, tackle outcome probabilities, minimum required effort per play, etc) 

* Interpret results, complete report and presentation


# Appendix 

## Among our effort metrics, Avg KE also best predicts Avg Yards Gained

## Avg KE and Avg EPA segment RBs into 4 quadrants

## Avg EPA for the 5 players with the highest KE and the 5 players with the lowest KE
