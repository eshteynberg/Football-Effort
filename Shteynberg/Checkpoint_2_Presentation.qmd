## Background and Motivation

* Traditional stats miss the "how" behind yards gained

* Previous research has explored athletes reaching theoretical max capacity [^1]

* Can we "measure" effort using tracking data?

  - Intangible and subjective
  - Depends on player position, defense faced, game context, snap count/play volume, play call/assignment

[^1]: Morin, et al. 2021. “Individual Acceleration-Speed Profile in-Situ: A Proof of Concept in Professional Football Players.” Journal of Biomechanics 123: 110524.


## Our Data: 2022 NFL Season 

* Game, play, player, tracking data from Weeks 1-9 [^2]

* Running plays where a running back (RB) is the ball carrier

* Trimmed each play to frames between handoff and end of play

## Motivation: acceleration-speed (AS) profiles tell us about players' acceleration capacities at different speeds (Morin et al., 2021)

## Effort = percentage of a player's points (frames) above the relaxed regression line

* Biased toward backups because of lower sample size...or are they just working harder? Are starters fatigued or pacing themselves? 

* Unrealistic theoretical max speeds - not comparable to soccer

## Quantile regression provides a better way of evaluating players' acceleration capacities

## New ways of looking at effort 

::: {.callout-note title="Effort v1" style="font-size: 1.5em;"}
$$
\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n_{\text{below}}} {\frac{1}{1+d_i}}\right)\bigg/n_{\text{below}}
$$
➜️ Quantifies *how close* a player comes to his "best" (99th percentile) accelerations

➜ Saquon Barkley: 0.152 

➜ Rex Burkhead: 0.149

::: {.callout-note title="Effort v2" style="font-size: 1.5em;"}
Percentage of total points that lie in between the percentile $P_{99}$ and $P_{99}-3$

➜ Quantifies *how often* a player comes close to his "best" (99th percentile) accelerations

➜ Saquon Barkley: 0.074 

➜ Rex Burkhead: 0.069
:::

## Concerns and limitations

* Unsure about threshold for relaxed percentile line in Effort v2

* Problem with `qgam`: some players have more than 1% of points above 99th percentile
  - Account for this issue without penalizing players who simply have large raw number of points above the line - should we include those points in the metric?

## Plan of action

* Define research question and scope ✅

* Data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA ✅

* Develop basic AS profiles for players ✅

* Obtain effort metric(s) with quantile regression ⏳

* Evaluate effort metric(s) by correlating it to effort-related outcomes
