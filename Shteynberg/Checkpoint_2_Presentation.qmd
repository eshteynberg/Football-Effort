## Background and Motivation

* Not all rushing yards are equal 

* Traditional stats miss the "how" behind yards gained

* Previous research has explored athletes reaching theoretical max capacity [^1]

* Can we "measure" effort using tracking data?

* Multiple ways of evaluating effort 

  - Intangible and subjective
  - Depends on player position, defense faced, game context, snap count/play volume, play call/assignment

## Our Data: 2022 NFL Season 

* Game, play, player, tracking data from Weeks 1-9 [^1]

* Running plays where a running back (RB) is the ball carrier

* Trimmed each play to frames between handoff and end of play

## Motivation: acceleration-speed (AS) profiles tell us about players' acceleration capacities at different speeds

## Effort is defined as the percentage of points above the relaxed line

* Biased toward backups because of lower sample size.. or are they just working harder after all? Are starters fatigued or pacing themselves? 

* Unrealistic theoretical max speeds

## Plan of action

* Define research question and scope ✅

* Data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA ✅

* Select effort metric(s)

* Evaluate effort metric(s) by correlating it to effort-related outcomes

* Use chosen metric(s) to answer questions related to effort (residual effort, tackle outcome probabilities, minimum required effort per play, etc)
