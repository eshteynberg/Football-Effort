    "text": "Introduction\nAmerican Football is one of the most-watched and popular sports in the U.S., known for its quick decision-making, complex tactics, and athletically demanding displays of strength, endurance and speed. However, many traditional statistics miss the “how” behind value plays such as yards gained after contact, expected points added, etc. As such, we must ask ourselves: what does it take to gain a yard? Is a player exceeding their capabilities, therefore, making an effort? If so, how often or how close does a player comes to his “best”?\nOur motivation for this project centered on these very questions. Our goal is to develop a metric to measure effort. We acknowledge that effort is a complex, intangible, and most often subjective concept, influenced by player position, opposing defense, snap count or play volume to play call/assignment. Effort is also heavily contextual and multi-faceted, often shaped by the emotional and mental state as well as the thinking process of a player. Given the available data, we are going to focus on one facet: the raw physical capabilities of a player — specifically, acceleration and speed.\nBy quantifying effort, we hope to provide not only to teams and sport data analysts, but also fans with deeper insight into what and how football players are truly contributing on the field — even when it’s not reflected in conventional stats or even the outcome of a game. We also aspire to address or even fill in some of the gaps in the current literature around quantifying effort in American football since most research focus on win probabilities and other outcomes at the game level rather than individualized capabilities."
