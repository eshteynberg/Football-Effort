    "text": "Introduction\nAmerican Football is one of the most-watched and popular sports in the U.S., known for its quick decision-making, complex tactics, and athletically demanding displays of strength, endurance and speed. However, many traditional statistics miss the “how” behind value plays such as yards gained after contact, expected points added, etc. As such, we must ask ourselves: what does it take to gain a yard? Is a player exceeding their capabilities, therefore, making an effort? If so, how often or how close does a player comes to his “best”?\nOur motivation for this project centered on these very questions. Our goal is to develop a metric to measure effort. We acknowledge that effort is a complex, intangible, and most often subjective concept, influenced by player position, opposing defense, snap count or play volume to play call/assignment. Effort is also heavily contextual and multi-faceted, often shaped by the emotional and mental state as well as the thinking process of a player. Given the available data, we are going to focus on one facet: the raw physical capabilities of a player — specifically, acceleration and speed.\nBy quantifying effort, we hope to provide not only to teams and sport data analysts, but also fans with deeper insight into what and how football players are truly contributing on the field — even when it’s not reflected in conventional stats or even the outcome of a game. We also aspire to address or even fill in some of the gaps in the current literature around quantifying effort in American football since most research focus on win probabilities and other outcomes at the game level rather than individualized capabilities."

    "text": "Methods\nIn this project, we define effort as a running back’s ability to consistently reach a combination of their individual maximal acceleration for any given speed.\n\nMetric #1: Linear Regression\n\nOur main methodological approach to addressing this question centered around previous research that has explored soccer players reaching their theoretical max acceleration capacity for every running speed (Morin et al. 2021). Similarly, we adopted this framework by plotting an individual running back’s profile based on the maximal acceleration the running back could generate for every possible running speed as follows:\n\nWithin a speed interval ranging between 3 mph and the RB’s maximal speed, the two maximal acceleration values attained for each 0.2 mph sub-intervals were selected.\nA first linear regression was fit to these speed-acceleration points.\nOutlier points lying outside of 95% confidence interval around the linear function were removed.\nA linear regression was fit to the remaining points.\n\nThis effort metric was derived by transforming final regression line downward by 0.25 units.\nEffort = percentage of points above the transformed regression line\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear quantile regression for acceleration(mph/s) vs speed(mph)\n\n\n\n\nMetric #2: Additive Quantile Regression Model\n\nThis metric quantifies how often a runnng back comes close to their maximal acceleration capacity.\nAssumption of this effort metric: high acceleration and/or high speed movements are effortful.\nFor each running back, two regression models with adaptive spline bases were fitted to the 0.98 quantiles of positive and negative acceleration, respectively, both as functions of running speed. A vertical line at the 0.99 quantile of speed was also drawn.\nThis metric was derived by\n       [LATEX equation] \n\nwhere di is the shortest distance from each point to its corresponding quantile regression line (either for positive or negative acceleration) or to the vertical line at the 0.99 quantile of speed\n- For points outside the quantile regression lines and/or the vertical line, the distance di was set to 0. \n- For negative acceleration points, **the effort score[change]** was penalized with by a factor of 0.5 as deceleration is deemed less effortful\n\n\nTop Running backs\n\n\n\n\nTop 10\n\n\n\n\nMetric #3: Ellipse [this metric might go on the appendix(???)]\n\nFor each running back, an ellipse was plotted with a vertex (x-intercept) at the 99th percentile of speed and co-vertices (y-intercepts) at the 99th percentiles of positive and negative acceleration, respectively.\nThis effort metric was derived in the same manner as for the quantile regression above, where di here is the shortest distance from each point to the ellipse."
