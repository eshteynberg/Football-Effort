    "text": "Introduction\nEffort is a fundamental—yet often invisible and subjective—dimension of athletic performance. In American Football, one of the most-watched and popular sports in the U.S., known for its quick decision-making, complex tactics, and athletically demanding displays of strength, endurance, and speed, traditional statistics like yards after contact or expected points added tend to focus on outcomes rather than the process behind them. This raises important questions: What does it take to gain a yard? Is a player exceeding their capabilities, therefore, making an effort? If so, how often or how close does a player come to their “best”?\nThese questions are at the heart of our project. While previous research in professional soccer has used theoretical maximum acceleration as a proxy for effort, no such framework currently exists in the NFL. Our goal is to address that gap by developing a player-specific, data-driven metric for measuring effort among running backs (RBs). Specifically, we focus on physical effort as expressed through raw acceleration and speed, which are variables we can observe directly in player tracking data.\nEffort, of course, is a complex, intangible, and most often subjective concept, influenced by mental and emotional state of a player as well as tactical and game factors, including player position, opposing defense, snap count or play volume to play call/assignment, and other game context. However, given the data available, we concentrate on one measurable facet: a player’s movement relative to his individual maximum capabilities. Using statistical models, we estimate each RB’s personal performance ceiling and assess how frequently and how closely they approach it during games.\nBy quantifying effort, we hope to provide not only to teams and sport data analysts, but also fans with deeper insights into how much football players are truly contributing on the field — even if they’re not reflected in conventional stats or the outcome of a game. In doing so, we also aim to contribute to a growing body of research around quantifying effort since most research focuses on win probabilities and other outcomes at the game level rather than at the individual level."

    "text": "Methods\nIn this project, we define effort as a running back’s ability to consistently reach a combination of their individual maximal acceleration for any given speed.\n\nMetric #1: Linear Regression\n\nOur main methodological approach to addressing this question centered around previous research that has explored soccer players reaching their theoretical max acceleration capacity for every running speed (Morin et al. 2021). Similarly, we adopted this framework by plotting an individual running back’s profile based on the maximal acceleration the running back could generate for every possible running speed as follows:\n\nWithin a speed interval ranging between 3 mph and the RB’s maximal speed, the two maximal acceleration values attained for each 0.2 mph sub-intervals were selected.\nA first linear regression was fit to these speed-acceleration points.\nOutlier points lying outside of 95% confidence interval around the linear function were removed.\nA linear regression was fit to the remaining points.\n\nThis effort metric was derived by transforming final regression line downward by 0.25 units.\nEffort = percentage of points above the transformed regression line\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear quantile regression for acceleration(mph/s) vs speed(mph)\n\n\n\n\nMetric #2: Additive Quantile Regression Model\n\nThis metric quantifies how often a runnng back comes close to their maximal acceleration capacity.\nAssumption of this effort metric: high acceleration and/or high speed movements are effortful.\nFor each running back, two regression models with adaptive spline bases were fitted to the 0.98 quantiles of positive and negative acceleration, respectively, both as functions of running speed. A vertical line at the 0.99 quantile of speed was also drawn.\nThis metric was derived by\n       [LATEX equation] \n\nwhere di is the shortest distance from each point to its corresponding quantile regression line (either for positive or negative acceleration) or to the vertical line at the 0.99 quantile of speed.\n\nFor points outside the quantile regression lines and/or the vertical line, the distance di was set to 0.\nFor negative acceleration points, the effort score[change] was penalized with by a factor of 0.5 as deceleration is deemed less effortful.\n\n\n\nTop Running backs\n\n\n\n\nTop 10\n\n\n\n\nMetric #3: Ellipse [this metric might go on the appendix(???)]\n\nFor each running back, an ellipse was plotted with a vertex (x-intercept) at the 99th percentile of speed and co-vertices (y-intercepts) at the 99th percentiles of positive and negative acceleration, respectively.\nThis effort metric was derived in the same manner as for the quantile regression above, where di here is the shortest distance from each point to the ellipse."
