You should also include descriptions of any relevant data pre-processing steps (e.g., whether you consider specific observations, create any meaningful features, etc.—but don’t mention minor steps like column type conversion, filtering out unnecessary rows)\nThe data used for this project were from NFL Big Data Bowl 2022 Dataset (NFL Big Data Bowl 2022) on Kaggle.\nWe limited our dataset to NFL running backs with more than 20 rushes."
