## Introduction 

Describe the problem and why it is important.

American Football is one of the most-watched and popular sports in the U.S., known for its quick decision-making, complex tactics, and athletically demanding displays of strength, endurance and speed.  


## Data

- Describe the data you’re using in detail, where you accessed it, along with relevant exploratory data analysis (EDA). You should also include descriptions of any relevant data pre-processing steps (e.g., whether you consider specific observations, create any meaningful features, etc.---but don't mention minor steps like column type conversion, filtering out unnecessary rows)

- The data used for this project were from NFL Big Data Bowl 2022 Dataset [@nfl2022] on Kaggle.

 - We limited our dataset to NFL running backs with more than 20 rushes.

## Methods

- Describe the modeling techniques you chose, their assumptions, justifications for why they are appropriate for the problem, and how you're comparing/evaluating the different methods.

- Used Dr. Ron Yurko and Quang Nguyen's code to calculate distance from the nearest defender [@qntkhvnAngle]

- Based our AS/ AKE curved on the article titled "Individual acceleration-speed profile in-situ: A proof of concept in professional football players"[@AS]

- Still using the non-linear quantile regression plot? [@quantReg]


## Results

Describe your results. This can include tables and plots showing your results, as well as text describing how your models worked and the appropriate interpretations of the relevant output. (Note: Don’t just write out the textbook interpretations of all model coefficients. Instead, interpret the output that is relevant for your question of interest that is framed in the introduction)

## Discussion

Give your conclusions and summarize what you have learned with regards to your question of interest. Are there any limitations with the approaches you used? What do you think are the next steps to follow-up your project? \cite{AS}
