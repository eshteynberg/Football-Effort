## What Does It Mean To Give 100%?

## Background

* Effort is intangible and subjective

* Currently no objective measure of effort exists in the NFL

* Idea: previous research has explored professional soccer players reaching theoretical max acceleration capacity[^1]

* Goals:

  * Improve estimation of individual acceleration-speed (A-S) profiles using statistical models
  
  * Assess how frequently players operate near or exceed their physical limits as a proxy for effort

[^1]: Morin, et al. 2021. “Individual Acceleration-Speed Profile in-Situ: A Proof of Concept in Professional Football Players.” Journal of Biomechanics 123: 110524.

  
## Data: 2022 NFL Season[^2]
 
* Game, play, player data from Weeks 1-9: 136 games

* Player tracking data: each observation is a frame in 10 fps

* Pre-processing:

  * Filtered to running plays where a running back (RB) is the ball carrier

  * Trimmed each play to frames between handoff and end of play
  
  * Derived directional acceleration

## Motivation: Estimate Each RB's Theoretical Max acceleration Frontier (Morin et al., 2021)

![](images/linear_AS_CMC_KH.png){width="100%" height="400"}

* Effort = % of a player's points (frames) close to and above the regression line

## But This Approach Has Limitations

* Gives no credit to low speed points

* Unrealistic theoretical max speeds - not comparable to soccer

* Penalizes players for being athletic 

* Does not differentiate between acceleration and deceleration
  
## Effort Metric #1: Quadratic Quantile Regression

## Effort Metric #2: Quantile Generalized Additive Model (QGAM)

## Computing Effort

::: {.callout-note title="Average frame-level effort for each player" style="font-size: 1.5em;"}
$$
\Psi_i = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{1+d_i} & a_i\geq 0 \\
  \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{1+d_i} & a_i<0
  \end{cases} \quad \implies \quad \text{Effort} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \Psi}{n}
$$

* **Effort Metric #1:**
  * Christian McCaffrey: 16.09%
  * Khalil Herbert: 19.84%
  
* **Effort Metric #2:**
  * Christian McCaffrey: 16.52%
  * Khalil Herbert: 18.81%

## Back-up RBs consistently lead in both effort metrics

## Effort metrics do not show a strong correlation with play outcomes

## Discussion

* Conclusions

  * A-S-based effort alone does not explain performance
  
  * Metric quantifies how often a player comes to his acceleration frontier
  
* Limitations

  * Metric does not fully account for game context
  
  * Personalized A-S curves make cross-player comparison difficult
  
* Future work

  * Applying metrics to wide receivers
  
  * Another way to validate effort metrics?
