## What Does It Mean To Give 100%?

* put the Saquon plot

## Background

* Effort is intangible and subjective

* Currently no objective measure of effort exists in the NFL

* Idea: previous research has explored pro soccer players reaching theoretical max acceleration capacity [^1]

* Goals:

  * Improve estimation of individual acceleration-speed (A-S) profiles using statistical models
  
  * Assess how frequently players operate near or exceed their limits as a proxy for effort

[^1]: Morin, et al. 2021. “Individual Acceleration-Speed Profile in-Situ: A Proof of Concept in Professional Football Players.” Journal of Biomechanics 123: 110524.

  
## Data: 2022 NFL Season [^2]

* Game, play, player data from Weeks 1-9: 136 games

* Player tracking data: each observation is a frame in 10 fps

* Pre-processing:

  * Filtered to running plays where a running back (RB) is the ball carrier

  * Trimmed each play to frames between handoff and end of play
  
  * Derived directional acceleration

## Motivation: Estimate each RB's theoretical maximum acceleration frontier (Morin et al., 2021)

* Effort = % of a player's points (frames) above the relaxed regression line

## Computing Effort

::: {.callout-note title="Average frame-level effort" style="font-size: 1.5em;"}
$$
\Psi_i = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{1+d_i} & a_i\geq 0 \\
  \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{1+d_i} & a_i<0
  \end{cases} \quad \implies \quad \text{Effort} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \Psi}{n}
$$
:::

* Effort Metric #1:
  * Christian McCaffrey: 16.09%
  * Khalil Herbert: 19.84%
  
* Effort Metric #2:
  * Christian McCaffrey: 16.52%
  * Khalil Herbert: 18.81%


## Back-up RBs consistently lead in both effort metrics

## Effort metrics do not show a strong correlation with play outcomes

## Discussion

* A-S-based effort alone does not explain performance

* Another way to validate effort metrics?

* Change the definition of effort? Incorporate game context?
